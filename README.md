History – 

In the times of "Kal Yuga", greed and hatred takes over the humanity for 6000 years. To end this, saints known as "Suryanshis" chose a man who could fight against all odds and defeat the Evil. He is taught to energize the "7 Chakras" of body through "Kandalini Yoga" that eventually gets him his Supernatural Powers. During this period he trains himself to gain control over his Powers by entering the Holy Fire and immersing his physical body in it. As a result the five elements of life, Fire, Earth, Water, Wind and Sky invigorates his body and eventually becomes "Shaktimaan".
