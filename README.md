History - In the times of  "Kal Yuga", greed and hatred has taken over the humanity for past 6000 years. To end this saints known as "Suryanshis" chose a man to fight against all odds and defeat the Evil. He was taught to energize the "7 Chakras" of body through "Kandalini Yoga" that helped him get Supernatural Powers. During this time he trained to get total control over his Powers by entering the Holy Fire and immersing his physical body in it. As a result the five elements of life, Fire, Earth, Water, Wind and Sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes "Shaktimaan".
Powers - "Shaktimaan" received powers from seven gurus(the followers of the Star Sun) who trained and blessed him with "Yogic Shakti"(natural power).
